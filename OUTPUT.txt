B) Description:

a program that determines the distribution of initial
digits in a set of data. In the end, we want a program that reads in a list of positive
numbers and outputs a list of 10 values: the frequency with which each digit 0–9 appears
as the nth digit of one of the input numbers.

C)Number pattern found:
	1 - zero is repeated the most.

D) Law outlining pattern:
	It obeys Benford's Law.

E)Optional task not done

F)Suggestion/comment:
	Such Tasks should be practiced in the labs where the lab assistants can help us in understanding 
it better prior to getting them as assignments so that we dont have to rely on google only to perform tasks 
as it is almost next to impossible as it is really hard to find time for these and majoity times the solutions
given in google are really next level and impossible to understand.

	Moreover, after the submission of assignments and labs , a proper class should be arranged to make us understand
our mistakes so that we can learn from them and not repeat them.
